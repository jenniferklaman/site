Created **Markov's Muse**, a Python-based text generation tool that produces creative text outputs using **Markov chains** trained on user-provided corpora.  

- Built the project in **Python**, implementing a **Markov chain model** to generate sentences based on input text.  
- Designed a **CLI interface** for users to input text, specify n-gram size, and generate outputs interactively.  
- Explored **text preprocessing techniques**, including tokenization and punctuation handling, to improve coherence in generated text.  
- Tested the tool on multiple literary corpora to produce **creative and readable outputs** for poetry, short stories, and prompts.  
- Learned about **probabilistic text modeling** and the challenges of small corpora in producing coherent language.  

This project demonstrates the potential for **algorithmic creativity** and serves as a foundation for more advanced NLP generation techniques.
