Built a **feedforward neural network** to classify phonemes from speech recordings, exploring basic architectures for speech recognition and feature learning.  

- Implemented the model in **Python** using **NumPy** and **PyTorch**, experimenting with different hidden layer sizes and activation functions.  
- Trained on a small dataset of annotated speech, **preprocessed into MFCC features**, to predict phoneme labels.  
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy and confusion matrices**, analyzing which phonemes were most challenging to classify.  
- Learned key insights into **feature extraction for speech** and the challenges of limited training data.  
- Served as a **hands-on introduction** to neural network design, data preprocessing, and model evaluation for linguistic data.  

This project helped me understand the **end-to-end workflow for speech recognition models**, from feature engineering to model evaluation.
