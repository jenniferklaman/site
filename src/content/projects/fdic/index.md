Developed a **data processing pipeline** to collect, standardize, and store over 23 years of quarterly FDIC reports for analysis by a team of engineers.  

- Built a **data collection application with Python and Selenium** to automatically extract structured financial data from FDIC reports. 
- Stored and organized the data in with **mySQL**, enabling efficient querying and feeding into an internal API.  
- Automated the **end-to-end data pipeline**, reducing manual effort and ensuring up-to-date, accurate financial datasets.  
- In collaboration with the very talented engineering team from the University of Miami's **Bonsai Research Group**
